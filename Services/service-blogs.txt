Hair Transplant:
Hair transplant is a surgical technique that moves hair follicles from a part of the body (the donor site) to a bald or balding part of the body (the recipient site). It is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness and provides natural-looking, permanent results.

Cosmetic Hair Patch:
A cosmetic hair patch is a non-surgical solution for hair loss. It involves attaching a custom-made hair system to the scalp, blending seamlessly with your natural hair for an instant transformation.

Eyebrow Reconstruction:
Eyebrow reconstruction is a procedure to restore or enhance the appearance of eyebrows using hair grafts or cosmetic techniques. It is ideal for those with thinning or lost eyebrows due to genetics, trauma, or medical conditions.

PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma):
PRP therapy uses the patient’s own blood, processed to concentrate platelets, and is injected into the scalp to stimulate hair growth and improve hair thickness naturally.

GFC (Growth Factor Concentrate):
GFC is an advanced hair restoration treatment that uses growth factors derived from the patient’s blood to promote hair regrowth and improve scalp health.

LASER Hair Removal:
Laser hair removal is a safe and effective method to reduce unwanted hair using concentrated light energy. It targets hair follicles, resulting in long-term hair reduction.

Vampire Facial:
A vampire facial combines microneedling with PRP to rejuvenate the skin, improve texture, and reduce signs of aging. It is a popular treatment for a youthful, radiant complexion.

Peel:
Chemical peels use specially formulated solutions to exfoliate and renew the skin, addressing concerns like pigmentation, acne, and dullness for a smoother, brighter appearance.
